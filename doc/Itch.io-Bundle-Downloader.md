# Description

Itch.io Bundle Downloader is a python script that allows the user to be able to download multiple bundles without having to go through the tedious task of pressing every single download button. This was made during a time where a bundle downloader didn't really exist, and now currently exists due to the complicated nature of some other applications and projects that exists when downloading bundles.
