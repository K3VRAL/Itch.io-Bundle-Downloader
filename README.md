# Itch.io Bundle Downloader

Itch.io Bundle Downloader is a python script that allows you to download all items in a bundle you bought. I made this when I bought the Ukraine Bundle. I got lazy and made this terrible script. Just start the application with `python download.py` and input the id of the bundle you have. This downloads items one by one but may be improved in the future.

## Usage

To be able to use this script, download the application either through git cloning this repo or downloading the zip file, to which you need to extract it. Once you have the contents in a folder, open up the terminal or console, and go into the directory which houses the contents, specifically the `download.py` file. Type into your terminal or console, `python download.py` to which you should have text popup to input the url id (Note: Make sure it is the ID of the bundle, not the full bundle's website). Once inputted, it will start to download all of the files, in which you can view the contents of the files in the folder of the same location.

You're ready to use this script, have fun!

If you are having errors: use the flag `-d` to see what the script is doing.

## TODO

Make a burner account on itch.io to see if this script would still work without an account.
