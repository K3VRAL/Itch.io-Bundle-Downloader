# Itch.io Bundle Downloader

Itch.io Bundle Downloader is a python script that allows you to download all items in a bundle you bought. I made this when I bought the Ukraine Bundle. I got lazy and made this terrible script. Just start the application with `python download.py` and input the id of the bundle you have. This downloads items one by one but may be improved in the future.
