TODOs

Do without user login (what the original script and the old branch was supposed to be based on).
Right now, I am unable to really test this out so I'll have to put this in the backburner
until I find a bundle worth investing not tied to my main account.

Look more into posting (to claim the data + get another bundle to do more testing).
Right now, I'm basing a lot of my code on the old code/branch.

Check if file exists on system then skip.
